Sales and Marketing (S&M) and Research and Development (R&D) are often competing for when it comes to company budgeting.

When taking a look at some of the largest software companies, we can see the variability of spending to be quite variable ranging from 25% right through to 100%.

Notably Paypal and Square, both companies who rely on third parties integrating them as a payment service and then earn a fee per transaction evidently require less Sales spend to get high revenues.

It does give you an insight into a company’s strategy, notably ServiceNow and Zendesk spending more on R&D as a proportion of Revenue compared to that of incumbent Salesforce. There’ll be a few reasons for this, undoubtedly Salesforce’s history and appetite for acquisitions would be a factor

## What is the optimum R&D spend?

If we were to run a regression against incremental change in Revenue only using incremental change in R&D and S&M spend solely we get an impressive R^2 of 0.57, meaning that 57% of variance in revenue can be explained solely to S&M and R&D.

There’s no real doubt that R&D and S&M are key drivers for increasing revenue, both proved by the model and also intuition.

However, one can hypothesise that there might be a stage in a company’s life where one more important than others?

When visualising Sales and Marketing Spend against Total Assets, we can see that there is a weak negative relationship. That is, the larger the company, the less they spend on S&M as a proportion of their revenue.

It is important to highlight the quite large variability in
