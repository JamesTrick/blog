Sales and Marketing (S&M) and Research and Development (R&D) are often competing for when it comes to company budgeting.

When taking a look at some of the largest software companies, we can see the variability of spending to be quite variable ranging from 25% right through to ![](/content/static/graphs/Top_Companies-1.png)100%.

Notably Paypal and Square, both companies who rely on third parties integrating them as a payment service and then earn a fee per transaction evidently require less Sales spend to get high revenues.It does give you an insight into a company’s strategy, notably ServiceNow and Zendesk spending more on R&D as a proportion of Revenue compared to that of incumbent Salesforce. There’ll be a few reasons for this, undoubtedly Salesforce’s history and appetite for acquisitions would be a factor

## What is the optimum R&D spend?

If we were to run a regression against incremental change in Revenue only using incremental change in R&D and S&M spend solely we get an impressive R^2 of 0.57, meaning that 57% of variance in revenue can be explained solely to S&M and R&D.

There’s no real doubt that R&D and S&M are key drivers for increasing revenue, both proved by the model and also intuition.

However, one can hypothesise that there might be a stage in a company’s life where one more important than others?

## Sales and Marketing Spend By Company Size

When visualising Sales and Marketing Spend against Total Assets, we can see that there is a weak negative relationship. That is, the larger the company, the less they spend on S&M as a proportion of their revenue.

## Research and Development Spend by Company Size

Equally on the R&D spend we see a weak relationship between R&D Spend and Assets, however the trend is positive.

By visualising data such as this, we can draw conclusions that smaller companies favour Sales and Marketing spend, perhaps in an attempt to increase their size, or due to lack of resource.

As mentioned above, it also gives a unique insight into a company's strategy and growth plans.
