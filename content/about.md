# Hi, I'm James.

I really enjoy doing things. I'm lucky that I get to solve a wide-range of business problems in my role as a Data Scientist at Xero.

Coming from an Economics/Finance educational background, I had a really strong mathematical base but lacked technical ability. Through self-study, I've since learned Python, R and SQL and applied it to a wide-range of real-world projects from time-series forecasting to NLP.

I've always actively seeked out new opportunities to improve things, this is shown with my success of becoming an Insights Analyst and now a Data Scientist - both roles in a newly created team following my work.

Outside of work, I'm typically out on the rugby field refereeing rugby or out on my motorbikes. Iâ€™m passionate about working with data and technology to show the #human side and to change people's lives.

Feel free to reach out to me at any time!
